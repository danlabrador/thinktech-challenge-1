#
# Example of expected output:
# If the inputs are 5 and 3, the output should be "Sum: 8, Product: 15, Difference: 2".
#
# Function Template:

def calculate_operations(num1, num2):
    # Your code here
    # Calculate sum
    # Calculate product
    # Calculate difference
    # Format and return the results as a string

    sum = num1 + num2
    product = num1 * num2
    difference = num1 - num2
    return f"Sum: {sum}, Product: {product}, Difference: {difference}" 
    return ""  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.
