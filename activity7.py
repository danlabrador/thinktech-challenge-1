# Activity 7: Comprehensive Challenge
#
# Task Description:
# Create a simple text-based quiz game that asks the user multiple-choice questions.
# Store the questions, choices, and correct answers in a suitable data structure.
# The game should ask each question in turn, allow the user to answer, and provide feedback.
# Finally, display the user's total score.
#
# Use functions to organize your code, data structures to store your quiz content,
# and control structures to manage the game flow.
#
# Note: For testing purposes, replace user input with function parameters where necessary.
#
# Example data structure for a question (you may design your own structure):
# quiz_data = [
#     {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "choices": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"], "correct_answer": "Paris"},
#     # Add more questions
# ]
#
# Function Template:

def run_quiz(quiz_data, user_answers):
    # Your code here
    # Iterate through each question in quiz_data
    # Compare each answer in user_answers with the correct answer
    # Track the number of correct answers
    # Return the total score

    return 0  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.

# Example function call for testing (replace with actual tests):
# print(run_quiz(quiz_data, ["Paris", "Incorrect Answer", ...]))
