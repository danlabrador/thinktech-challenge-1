# Activity 4: Lists, For Loops, and Functions
#
# Task Description:
# Write a function named process_list that takes a list of numbers as an input.
# The function should return two things:
# - The sum of the numbers in the list.
# - The list reversed.
# Return these as a tuple: (sum_of_numbers, reversed_list)
#
# Example of expected output:
# If the input list is [1, 2, 3], the output should be (6, [3, 2, 1]).
#
# Function Template:

def process_list(numbers):
    # Your code here
    # 1. Calculate the sum of the numbers
    # 2. Reverse the list
    # Return the results as a tuple

    return (0, [])  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.
