# Activity 6: While Loops and Input Validation
#
# Task Description:
# Create a function named get_valid_number that asks the user for input and keeps asking until
# the user provides a valid number (integer or float). Once a valid number is received, return it.
# For this task, assume the input() function will be replaced by a parameter to the function
# for testing purposes. This means your function should take a list of inputs to simulate
# user input during testing.
#
# Note: Normally, you would use input() to get user input, but for automated testing,
# we will simulate inputs with a list. Your function should iterate through this list to simulate
# user interaction.
#
# Example of expected behavior:
# If the list of inputs is ["a", "25.5", "30"], your function should ignore "a" because it's not a number,
# accept "25.5" as a valid number, and stop asking for more input.
#
# Function Template:

def get_valid_number(inputs):
    # Your code here
    # Iterate over the inputs list
    # Validate each input to check if it's a valid number
    # Return the first valid number found

    return None  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.
