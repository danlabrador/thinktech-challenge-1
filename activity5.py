# Activity 5: Tuples, Dictionaries, and String Formatting
#
# Task Description:
# Create a function named format_data that takes two parameters:
# - A tuple containing three elements: first name (string), last name (string), and age (integer).
# - A dictionary containing one key-value pair, where the key is 'favorite_color' and the value is a string.
# The function should return a single string that combines the information from the tuple and the dictionary
# in a readable format.
#
# Example of expected output:
# If the tuple is ("John", "Doe", 30) and the dictionary is {"favorite_color": "blue"},
# the output should be "John Doe is 30 years old and loves the color blue."
#
# Function Template:

def format_data(person_info, additional_info):
    # Your code here
    # Extract data from the tuple and dictionary
    # Format and return the combined information as a string

    return ""  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.
