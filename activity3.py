# Activity 3: Inputs, Control Structures, If…else Statements
#
# Task Description:
# Create a program that asks for the user's age and categorizes it into one of the following groups:
# - Minor (less than 18 years old)
# - Young Adult (18 to 40 years old)
# - Adult (older than 40 years)
# The program should return a string indicating the category.
#
# Note: For the purpose of testing, instead of using input(), define a function named categorize_age
# that takes age as a parameter and returns the category.
#
# Example of expected output:
# If the input is 25, the output should be "Young Adult".
#
# Function Template:

def categorize_age(age):
    # Your code here
    # Use if…else statements to determine the age category
    # Return the category as a string

    return ""  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.
